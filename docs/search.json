The objective of the Decision Tree algorithm is to maximize information gain at each split in the tree. Each branch represents an outcome of a test based on a feature of the training set. At the root node, the feature with the highest predictive power is used to split the tree. For each decision/internal node, a feature of the dataset is tested against a certain value and the tree is traveled based on the results. Once a leaf node is reached, a condition to stop spliting is achieved and a prediction is made. If the algorithm is running as regression, the mean of the response for observations that fall in this region are returned. Otherwise, the mode of the response (the target label that occurs the most) is returned."

This keeps their customer attrition low as customers would not be erroneously charged for purchases they did not make. Creating models to accurately detect fraudlent transactions proves to be extremely difficult as training datasets tend to be heavily imbalance due to a significantly higher amount of non-fraudulent activity than fraudulent. This project aims to address this problem by using various machine learning techniques to create a model to predict fraudulent credit card activity."

Feature selection decreases over-fitting, reduces the amount of time to train the model, and additionally improves accuracy since misleading data in the non-essential features have been removed.\nIn my project, I used a simple method to select the important features; I calculated the correlation between each of the features and the target. I then used the seaborn and matplotlib libraries to generate a heat map:\n\nI then looked for features that had an absolute value of 0.4 or greater. Suprisingly to me, the amount of the transaction was not highly correlated to the target. I found these features to be the most correlated: \"V1\",\"V2\",\"V3\",\"V4\",\"V5\",\"V6\",\"V7\",\"V9\",\"V10\",\"V11\",\"V12\",\"V14\",\"V16\",\"V17\",\"V18\""

I do, however, need to scale the time and amount columns as the other columns are already scaled due to the PCA that was conducted on them. In order to do this, I utilized the StandardScaler class from the sklearn.preprocessing library. I also went ahead and split the data into a training and test dataset using the train_test_split method from the sklearn.model_selection. I split the data 70/30, with 70% being the training dataset and the remaining 30% constituting the test dataset. This does cause an issue, however, since the data is so heavily imbalanced. Stayed tuned to see how I overcame this."

However, because of the severly imbalanced dataset, the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) is a better metric to compare. For the Logistic Regression and Decision Tree algorithms, the oversampled version performed better. For the KNN and Random Forest Algorithms, the undersampled versions performed better. The algorithm that appeared to perform the best overall with the AUPRC metric was the oversampled version of the Logistic Regression algorithm. The algorithm that had the less amount of misclassifications, however, was the oversampled version of the Random Forest algorithm."

I will use both undersampling and oversampling techniques and compare the results.\n\nUndersampling occurs when you take a smaller sample of the majority class (in this case, the majority class is nonfraudulent transactions) in order to create a smaller, but more balanced dataset.\nOversampling occurs when you take a large sample of the minority class by duplicating minority class rows (in this case, the minority class is fraudulent transactions) in order to create a larger, but more balanced dataset."

This dataset will provide an unique challenge due to the data being highly imbalanced, skewed heavily towards non-fraudulent activity.\nThere are 31 columns in the dataset with 28 of them having undergone a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality (except for the time, amount, and class columns).

    "text": "Overall, the oversampled version of all algorithms performed better than their undersampled counterparts. Not only did the oversampled versions perform better, but they were also less sensitive to perturbations in the data and were more generalizable. The algorithm that was most insensitive/generalizable was the oversampled version of the Random Forest algorithm with a maximum standard deviation in metrics of 0.0073%."
