Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation consists of splitting the training dataset into K ‘folds,’ in which each fold contains the same proportion of the target. In each of ‘k’ iterations, one fold is used as the test set, while the remaining are used for training the model. A Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation strategy makes sure no value is over/under-represented in either the training or test sets. This allows us to receive a more accurate estimation of the performance and error.

The oversampled version of Logistic Regression had a lower standard deviation for all metrics - this indicates that this model was more generalizable than the undersampled version. The oversampled version also appeared to have performed better on average when comparing the average metrics. The maximum standard deviation between the metrics for the oversampled algorithm was 0.26%, which is fairly low.

#### Overampled SVM Stratified K-Fold Results
The oversampled SVM model did not seem to reach convergence, therefore, it was eliminated.

The oversampled version also appeared to have performed better on average when comparing the average metrics. The maximum standard deviation between the metrics for the oversampled algorithm was 0.023%, which is significantly low.
