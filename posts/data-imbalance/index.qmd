In order to account for the heavy imbalance in non-fraudulent transactions to fraudulent transactions, I utitlized both the `RandomUnderSampler` and the `RandomOverSampler` classes from the `imblearn` library. Both samplers take an `sampling_strategy` input parameter that allow us to specify a percentage to over/under sample by. I will use both undersampling and oversampling techniques and compare the results.

Undersampling occurs when you take a smaller sample of the majority class (in this case, the majority class is nonfraudulent transactions) in order to create a smaller, but more balanced dataset.

Oversampling occurs when you take a large sample of the minority class by duplicating minority class rows (in this case, the minority class is fraudulent transactions) in order to create a larger, but more balanced dataset.
